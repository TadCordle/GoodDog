Hello! A couple things to note if you want to use the level editor:

- I made the level editor mostly for myself, in a very short amount of time. So apologies for any jankiness.
- The level file is saved in the "resources" folder as "level.txt". In desperate times, you can edit this
  file with a text editor to fix things.
- Saving (ctrl+s) will overwrite whatever "level.txt" is currently in the resources folder (which is also 
  the level that gets loaded when the game boots). So if you want to start a new level, make sure to move
  or rename the existing level.txt first.
- The win condition is pretty hardcoded, so for best results, build levels with similar start/end conditions
  to the base game (i.e. flat, open areas for the start screen and ball screens)

If you make any cool levels please do share them!
